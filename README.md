### RTL Simulation Benchmarks
Compare the simulator generation, compilation time and performance of different RTL simulator generators on RochetChip.
We run generated simulators for `RocketCore` (small size) and `BOOM` (large size) on RISC-V benchmarking elfs.

#### How to run 
```shell
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/zihan0822/rtl-sim-bench
```

##### Prerequisite 
Please pre-compiled the following dependencies. To accommodate some of the tools, you need to add the compiled binary to `$PATH`.
* Our own fork of `patronus-sim/yosys` is required to support lowering of large Verilog files.
* `repcut-sim/kahypar` is required by RepCut for novel circuit partitioning.

```shell
# compile simulator generated by different tools with different configs
$ ./compile.sh
# simulator parallel run
$ python3 run.py
```

##### Artifacts
Performance data can be found at `results/`.

Compile time related data can be found at `build-*` directory of each tools
* `gen-time.log`: simulator generation time, which refers to Verilog to C++ for Verilator, FIRRTL to C++ for ESSENT and RepCut, FIRRTL to LLVM IR for Khronous and Verilog to BTOR2 for patronus
* `compile-time.log`: compilation time of generated simulators
